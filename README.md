# National Park Performance Project

## Background

We've just laneded our dream job as a Senior Data Analyst at the National Park Service (NPS). For our first task we will analyze the data for Park Attendance and Budget Costs for each National Park from 1979 - 2020.

## Instructions

Our tasks will be the following:

* Is there a corelation between budget costs and park attendence. 
* Determine how much money it cost you, as a tax payer, in order to have the luxary of visiting a specific National Park.
* Is tax payer money being used effectively?
* Compare National Park performance between States and individual parks to determine most effective.
* Allow users to select a Park and year to view tax payer effectiveness.
* Where does your tax dollar get the most bang for its buck?

## Resources

* We will use a google api to geocode the National Parks and create heat maps. [Google API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search)

* We will be using an inflation API in order to adjust past budgets for inflation. [Stat Bureau](https://www.statbureau.org/en/united-states/inflation-charts-monthly-year-over-year)

* We will use the US Spending API in order to pull the budget cost data. [US Spending](https://api.usaspending.gov/)
