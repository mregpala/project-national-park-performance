# National Park Performance Project




## Background




We've just landed our dream job as a Senior Data Analyst at the National Park Service (NPS). For our first task we will analyze the data for Park Attendance and Budget Costs for each National Park from 1979 - 2020.




## Instructions




Our tasks will be the following:




* Is there a correlation between budget costs and park attendance. 

* Determine how much money it cost you, as a tax payer, in order to have the luxury of visiting a specific National Park.

* Is tax payer money being used effectively?

* Compare National Park performance between States and individual parks to determine most effective.

* Allow users to select a Park and year to view tax payer effectiveness.

* Where does your tax dollar get the most bang for its buck?




## Resources




* We will use a google API to geocode the National Parks and create heat maps. [Google API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search)




* We will be using an inflation API in order to adjust past budgets for inflation. [Stat Bureau](https://www.statbureau.org/en/united-states/inflation-charts-monthly-year-over-year)




* We will use the US Spending API in order to pull the budget cost data. [US Spending](https://api.usaspending.gov/)




* We will be using the National Park Service website to gather attendance data. [NPS](https://irma.nps.gov/STATS/SSRSReports/National%20Reports/Annual%20Park%20Ranking%20Report%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year))
